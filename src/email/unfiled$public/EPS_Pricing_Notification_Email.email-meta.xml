RE: Paperless Price Communications


Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}


Effective immediately EPS will communicate pricing notifications via Email. This will improve the timeliness as well as the accuracy of information. We are committed to improving our communications as well as the environment. Please contact your sales representative {!Contact.OwnerFullName} at {!Contact.OwnerEmail}, {!Contact.OwnerPhone} to continue to receive paper notifications.


Thank you for your cooperation,

Henry Bunch

Division Vice President
